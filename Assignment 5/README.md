# Assignment #5:
 
You have done a very good job at Century 21st as a Python Developer. One day you saw a job advertisement for a Senior Programmer at the Canadian Space Agency on Indeed.com. Being who you are, you could not let the opportunity pass you by.
 
Canadian Space Agency (CSA) is an equivalent of North America Space Agency (NASA) in the USA. Theyâ€™re both known for their track records for hiring top-notch Scientists. You decided to give the opportunity a shot.
Long behold you are lucky, and you actually landed the job as a Python and Database Senior Programmer/Scientist.
 
Your first assignment is to design a simple computer program to help convert from Metric to SI units anything you all do at CSA which uses the same system as any other commonwealth country.
 
You design a Program to come up with a software to convert:
 
1)	Temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and back
2)	Convert Nautical Miles to KMS and back,
3)	Convert Kilometer to Miles and back,
4)	Convert Centimeters to meters and back
5)	Convert Yard to Meters and back,
6)	Convert Inches to Centimeters and back
Your program should be menu driven with Options to pick from the running program.
